The following Repo holds simple examples and tutorials to work with GDAL to get
data out of GIS dataset's. 

These examples will include:
* loading Shapes
* loading DEMs
* loading Geotiffs and other formats as well
* A brief demonstration of translating between two different projections
* A simple OpenGL demonstration....

Here is some reading material on projections:

* 

In these links you will be introduced to OGR and how to go between projections.
For example code look at the OGRExample folder.

Here is an example of what will be possible with the given data.
